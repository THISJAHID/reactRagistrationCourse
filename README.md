# React + Vite
Add at least 3 Project features?

  1.   React Router for Navigation:
    Implement client-side routing using React Router. This allows you to create a single-page application (SPA) with multiple views or pages. Users can navigate through your app without requiring full-page reloads, providing a smoother user experience.

 2.   State Management with Redux or Context API:
    Depending on the complexity of your project, consider using Redux or React's Context API for state management. These tools help you manage and share global application state efficiently, making it easier to pass data between components and maintain a consistent application state.

 3.   Responsive Design with CSS Grid or Flexbox:
    Ensure that your React project is responsive and mobile-friendly by using CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout and design. Responsive design ensures that your application adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.




    In a React project, there are two primary ways to manage state: local component state and global state management.

    1. Local Component State:
        Local component state is managed within individual React components. You can use the useState hook or the this.state approach in class components to create and update local state. Local state is typically used for managing data that is specific to a particular component and does not need to be shared with other components.

    

   2. Global State Management:
        In larger and more complex React projects, you might need to share state between multiple components. In such cases, you can use global state management libraries and patterns like Redux, Mobx, or React Context API. These tools allow you to create a centralized store or context where data can be stored and accessed by different parts of your application.

        For example, if you were using Redux:

        You would define a global store that holds your application's state.
        You would use actions to update the state and reducers to handle those actions.
        Components can connect to the store to access and modify the global state as needed.

        Here's a simplified example using Redux:
        Remember that the choice between local state and global state management depends on the complexity and requirements of your project. In your assignment project, you can discuss which approach you used and explain your reasoning for that choice based on the project's needs.
